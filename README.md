# MVC Application with ExpressJS & MySQL

This application is a web platform built using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture with Express.js as the primary web framework. The application utilizes MySQL as the relational database to store and manage information, EJS as the templating engine to generate dynamic views, and Knex.js as the SQL query builder to handle database connections and operations.

## Key Features

- **Express.js**: A powerful and flexible Node.js web framework for building modern web applications.
- **MySQL**: Used as the relational database to store and manage application data.
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)**: A templating engine that allows the use of JavaScript directly in HTML to build dynamic views.
- **Knex.js**: SQL query builder that provides a friendly interface to interact with MySQL databases.

## Project Structure

- **Model**: Contains the definition of data models and application logic related to the database.
- **View**: Stores the application views generated using EJS.
- **Controller**: Handles user requests, processes data from models, and generates views using the view layer.
- **Configuration**: Directory containing configuration files, including database connection configuration.
- **Migrations**: Directory containing database migration scripts using Knex.js to manage database versions and structure.
- **Routes**: Stores the definitions of application routes or endpoints to handle HTTP requests from users.
- **Static Files**: Directory containing static files such as images, stylesheets, and JavaScript scripts.

This application is ready to be further developed by adding new features according to your project needs.
